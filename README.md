# Mass media management automation

Downloading my photos from Google Photos, I realised that there was no coherent naming convention.

To overcome this, I wanted to build something that would automatically rename my photos to match the date that it was created. Luckily, the downloaded data from Google Photos comes with a JSON metadata file for each photo, which contains useful information that I might use in the future -- such as to further sort my photos by location.
